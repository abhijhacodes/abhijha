- [React 17](https://react.dev/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

#### Steps to run this locally:

- Clone this repository

  git clone https://github.com/abhijhacodes/abhijha.git
  ```
- Move into the repository folder
- Install dependencies using this command ðŸ‘‡
  ```bash
  npm i --legacy-peer-deps
  ```
  (I am too lazy to fix upstream dependency conflicts, you can try that on your own if you want to, otherwise this version also works fine.)

  npm run dev
  ```
- Build app for production
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
