> After over a month of Design <-> Redesign Build <-> Rebuild and thousands of lines of code finally completed building my personal portfolio

<br />

### Tech Stack I used for this project

<br />

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

[Markdown](https://mdxjs.com/)

<brl />
<br />

<br />

#### Reasons for choosing this stack:

<ul>
  <li>
    I prefered to use Next.js over plain react because of it's better
    performace(because of the new Rust compiler introduced in version 12). Much
    better SEO optimization and ready to use File based routing system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using Typescript over Javascript because of type safety, reliability,
    explicity and what not :)
  </li>
  <li>
    I initially started building this portfolio with Tailwind CSS but later on
    as switched to Chakra UI because it's easier to create responsive design
    with robust and concise code, plenty of higher order components(that you can
    see all over this site), dark and light theme with just few lines of code,
    etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

I have created this blog section inside my portfolio itself to share some useful stuff with the world.

Here I'll write some text based tutorials for competitive programming ðŸ“Š and development

### A sneak peak into the scary codebase:

I've used [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for email delivery service and [Prism
react renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) for
syntax highlighting in the code blocks.

**Here's a small code snippet to show how you can use Prism react renderer and Chakra UI to show code blocks inside your website**

<br />

```typescript:CodeBlock.tsx
import Highlight, { defaultProps, Language } from "prism-react-renderer";
import darkTheme from "prism-react-renderer/themes/nightOwl";
import lightTheme from "prism-react-renderer/themes/vsLight";
import { FaCopy } from "react-icons/fa";
import { Box, Button, useClipboard, useColorMode } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { useRef } from "react";

interface CodeBlockProps {
  children: string;
  className: string;
}

export const CodeBlock = ({ children, className }: CodeBlockProps) => {
  const { colorMode } = useColorMode();
  const { hasCopied, onCopy } = useClipboard(children.trim());
  const codeRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const language: unknown = className ? className.replace(/language-/, "") : "";

  return (
    <Box fontSize="sm" position="relative" ref={codeRef}>
      <Button
        rightIcon={<FaCopy />}
        colorScheme="telegram"
        size="sm"
        variant="outline"
        position="absolute"
        top={-10}
        right={4}
        onClick={onCopy}
      >
        {hasCopied ? "Copied ðŸ‘Œ " : "Copy "}
      </Button>
      <Highlight
        {...defaultProps}
        theme={colorMode === "dark" ? darkTheme : lightTheme}
        code={children}
        language={language as Language}
      >
        {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
          <pre
            className={className}
            style={{
              ...style,
              padding: 10,
              overflowX: "auto",
            }}
          >
            {tokens.map((line, i) => (
              <div key={i} {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span key={key} {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </div>
            ))}
          </pre>
        )}
      </Highlight>
    </Box>
  );
};

```
