> Reverse Nodes in k-Group is one of the most frequently asked interview problems related to Linked list, in this blog I'm going to explain it's intuitive recursive solution

<br />

[Problem link for practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

<br />

### Pre-requisites:

[Linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/)

[Reverse a linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/)

<br />

### Problem statement:

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

<br />

### Example:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

<br />
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

<br />

### Steps to solve:

<ul>
  <li>
    We need to reverse all the groups of k nodes and at last if less than k
    nodes are left, we do nothing.
  </li>
  <li>We can reverse each group using reverse the linked list logic.</li>
  <li>
    Solve each group separately one after other using recursion and keep
    attaching result of each operation to linked list.
  </li>
</ul>

```cpp:solution.cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {

        // if head is null or k = 1, do nothing
        if(!head or k == 1) return head;
        ListNode *oldHead = head, *newHead = NULL, *curr = head;

        // go to kth node of group, that will be newHead after reversal
        for(int i = 0; i < k-1; i++) {
            curr = curr->next;
            // if less than k nodes are left, do nothing
            if(!curr) return head;
        }
        newHead = curr;

        // reversing group of k nodes
        ListNode *prev = NULL, *nxt = NULL;
        curr = head;

        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            nxt = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nxt;
        }

        // attach result of recursively solving remaining n-k nodes
        // to oldHead and return newHead
        oldHead->next = reverseKGroup(curr, k);

        return newHead;
    }
};
```
